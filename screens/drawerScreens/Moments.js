          <Text style={styles.heading}>Permission Handling:</Text> Before
          accessing the media library, the app requests the necessary
          permissions, adhering to best practices for user privacy and security.

          <Text style={styles.heading}>Handling Image Selection: </Text> The app
          uses the expo-image-picker library to allow users to select images
          from their deviceâ€™s gallery.

          <Text style={styles.heading}>Asynchronous Storage:</Text> Selected
          profile images are stored persistently using

          remains available across app sessions.

          various states like photos, captions, selectedImage, and others to
          control the UI and logic. The state updates are triggered whenever a
          new image is added or an image is deleted.

          <Text style={styles.heading}>User Interactions:</Text> Users can
          delete photos with captions through a delete button, which updates the
          photos and captions states accordingly. Users are prompted to enter
          captions for images when they select an image. If no caption is
          entered, the app will prompt the user again.

          interaction clarity.
